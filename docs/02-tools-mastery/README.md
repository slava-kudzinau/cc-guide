# Part 2: Tools Mastery (CLI & VS Code Extension)

This part provides comprehensive coverage of Claude Code's command-line interface and VS Code extension, from basic terminal workflows to advanced automation patterns.

## Why CLI & Extension Mastery Matters

**CLI enables:**
- Scriptable workflows - Automate repetitive tasks
- Unix composition - Pipe commands together
- CI/CD integration - Run in automated pipelines
- Terminal-first development - Stay in your flow
- Team automation - Share scripts across team

**Extension enables:**
- Visual feedback - Side-by-side diffs
- Plan Mode - Review changes before applying
- Interactive development - Iterative problem solving
- Learning - Explore code with guidance
- Safe refactoring - Multi-file changes with control
