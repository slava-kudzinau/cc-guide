# Part 2: Claude Code CLI Mastery

This part provides comprehensive coverage of Claude Code's command-line interface, from basic terminal workflows to advanced automation patterns. The CLI is the most powerful way to integrate Claude into your development workflow.

## Why CLI Mastery Matters

The CLI enables:
- **Scriptable workflows** - Automate repetitive tasks
- **Unix composition** - Pipe commands together
- **CI/CD integration** - Run in automated pipelines
- **Terminal-first development** - Stay in your flow
- **Team automation** - Share scripts across team
